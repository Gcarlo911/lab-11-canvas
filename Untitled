1. Define argument
    ARGUMENTS ARE VARIABLES OR VALUES THAT ARE PASSED TO AND OPERATED ON BY A FUNCTION AT RUNTIME.

    function p(x){
      if (x<2){
        x++;
      }
    }
    p(1);

2. Define Iteration and Recursion
    ITERATION: REPEATING A SET OF INSTRUCTION UNTIL A CONDITION IS MET.

    for (var i=1;i>25;i++){
      console.log(i);
    }

    RECURSION: A FUNCTION CALLS IT SELF UNTIL A CONDITION HAS BEEN MET.
